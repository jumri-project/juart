    "When training a model the slices and subjects of the datasets should not be in order. Therefore this function creates a random order for every single epoch, granting that every slice is used once and only once in every epoch. It is possible to give the function a seed so that the random order is the same order in every training. This is used for better comparability of the models, because the accuracy of the models can slightly variate with the order of the slices and subjects in the training."
